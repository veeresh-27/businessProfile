              that pools funds from investors and invests in equities, bonds, government securities,
              gold, and other assets. Companies that qualify to set up mutual funds, create Asset
              Management Companies (AMCs) or Fund Houses, which pool in the money from investors,
              market mutual funds, manage investments and enable investor transactions. Mutual funds
              are managed by sound financial professionals known as fund managers, who have the
              expertise in analysing and managing investments. The funds collected from investors in
              mutual funds are invested by the fund managers in different financial assets such as
              stocks, bonds, and other assets, as defined by the fundâ€™s investment objective. Where
              and when to invest are some of the things taken care of by the fund managers, amongst
              many other responsibilities.

              For the fund management, the AMC charges a fee to the investor known as the expense
              ratio. It is not a fixed fee and varies from one mutual fund to another. SEBI has
              defined the maximum limit of the expense ratio that can be charged on the basis of the
              total assets of the fund. In India, the capital markets regulator SEBI (Securities and
              Exchange Board of India) has encouraged the mutual fund industry by creating a system
              that works for the benefit of all stakeholders, including investors and mutual fund
              sponsors. Regulations are passed from time to time which improves functioning and help
              attract investments and generate growth.
